# US Economic Forecast Q2 2025 | Deloitte Insights

Hey everyone! Let's dive into the US economic crystal ball and see what might be shaking in Q2 2025. Predicting the future is tricky business, but by looking at different scenarios, we can get a better grasp of the possibilities.  Think of it like choosing your own adventure, economic style!

## The Baseline: Steady as She Goes

Our baseline forecast is the most likely scenario, based on what we know today.  It's like the "expected route" on your GPS.  We're assuming the average tariff rate hangs around 15%—even with some legal back-and-forth.  Think of tariffs like taxes on imported goods.  While the overall rate stays put, we expect some shifts for specific countries and products. For example, tariffs on stuff coming from Canada and Mexico should gradually drop to about 3% next year. This is because exporters in those countries are likely to adapt to the new trade landscape by shifting production or finding alternative markets.

What does this mean for you?  Probably not a huge, sudden change.  Think slow and steady growth, not a rollercoaster.

## The Adverse Scenario: Bump in the Road

Now, let's talk about the "detour" scenario.  The adverse scenario considers things that could throw a wrench in the works, like a sudden spike in oil prices or a global trade war escalating.  Imagine a supply chain disruption causing shortages of key components, leading to higher prices for consumers.  Not fun, right?

In this scenario, we might see slower economic growth, maybe even a slight dip.  Businesses might hold off on investments, and consumer spending could take a hit.

## The Optimistic Scenario: Smooth Sailing

But hey, let's not get too gloomy!  The optimistic scenario is the "fast lane" on our economic highway.  Imagine breakthroughs in renewable energy technology boosting investment and creating new jobs.  Or maybe consumer confidence soars, leading to a spending spree.

This scenario could mean faster economic growth, lower unemployment, and a general feeling of prosperity.  Think sunshine and rainbows (economically speaking, of course).

## Key Factors to Watch

Regardless of which scenario plays out, a few key factors will shape the US economy in Q2 2025:

* **Consumer Spending:** How much we buy impacts everything! If we're feeling confident, we spend more, boosting the economy.
* **Investment:** Businesses investing in new equipment, technology, and people create jobs and drive growth.
* **Trade:**  Those tariffs we talked about? They can have a big impact on how much we import and export, influencing prices and economic activity.
* **Government Policies:**  Decisions made in Washington D.C. can affect everything from taxes to regulations, shaping the economic landscape.


## What's the Bottom Line?

Predicting the future is impossible, but by considering different scenarios, we can get a better sense of what might happen.  The baseline scenario suggests steady growth, but unexpected events could lead to either a bump in the road or a period of smooth sailing.  Keep an eye on those key factors we discussed – they'll give you valuable clues about where the economy is headed.
